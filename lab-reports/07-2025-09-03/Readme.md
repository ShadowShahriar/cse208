## Prerequisite

Create a database named **company**:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE company;
```

Create two tables: `employee` and `department`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee(emp_id int(6), emp_name varchar(12), job_name varchar(16), manager_id int(6), hire_date varchar(12), salary int(8), commission int(8), dep_id int(4));
CREATE TABLE department(dep_id int(4), dep_name varchar(16), dep_location varchar(24));
```

Inserting data into the tables:

```sql
-- Inserting data into `employee`
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(68319, "KAYLING", "PRESIDENT", NULL, "1991-11-18", 600000, NULL, 1001);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(66928, "BLAZE", "MANAGER", 68319, "1991-05-01", 275000, NULL, 3001);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(67832, "CLARE", "MANAGER", 68319, "1991-06-09", 255000, NULL, 1001);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(65646, "JONAS", "MANAGER", 68319, "1991-04-02", 295700, NULL, 2001);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(67858, "SCARLET", "ANALYST", 65646, "1997-04-19", 310000, NULL, 2001);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(69062, "FRANK", "ANALYST", 65646, "1991-12-03", 310000, NULL, 2001);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(63679, "SANDRINE", "CLERK", 69062, "1990-12-18", 90000, NULL, 2001);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(64989, "ADELYN", "SALESMAN", 66928, "1991-02-20", 170000, 40000, 3001);
INSERT INTO employee VALUES(65271, "WADE", "SALESMAN", 66928, "1991-02-22", 135000, 60000, 3001);

-- Inserting data into `department`
INSERT INTO department VALUES(1001, "FINANCE", "SYDNEY");
INSERT INTO department VALUES(2001, "AUDIT", "MELBOURNE");
INSERT INTO department VALUES(3001, "MARKETING", "PERTH");
INSERT INTO department VALUES(4001, "PRODUCTION", "BRISBANE");

> [!NOTE]
> The `LIMIT` clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
>
> ```sql
> SELECT COL_NAME, ...
> FROM T_NAME
> LIMIT OFFSET, ROW_COUNT;
